This appears to be due to confusion around OP_1. Specifically, while OP_0 is 0x00, OP_1 is actually 0x51.\r\nThis portion can easily be resolved by updating the documentation to reflect 0x01 instead of OP_1 (0x51).\r\n\r\nThere is additional confusion as currently inscriptions use 0x0101XX (where XX is length in bytes) between the `PROTOCOL_ID` and the `content_type`. The above statement resolves why the first 0x01 exists, but, I believe the second should be OP_PUSHDATA1 (0x4C), but it is mistakenly using 0x01 (Load one byte).\r\n\r\nThese two combined could adversely impact the ability of third-parties to implement Inscriptions (which I believe is desirable).

It loses the point of the artifact itself, as discouraged by the ordinals handbook as well.\r\n\r\nGiven this scenario, I think it would be cool if the Ordinals Protocol can come up with a solution that addresses both cost scalability for launching multiple inscriptions (collections) and resource quality, so that it can kill two birds with one stone (this expression feels so strange these days): high res image available for webapps to use and still cheap for users to upload the artifact on chain.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is the following, introduce a new convention for an optional meta JSON object, that must be serialized to string and inscribed right after ContentType and ContentBytes, as ContentMetaBytes (should always be assumed to be a valid JSON... if not, the Ord wallet ignores it):\r\n```JSON\r\n[\r\n   {\r\n      \"name\":\"Legendary Sword\",\r\n      \"high_res_img_url\":\"https://example.com/legendary_sword.jpg\",\r\n      \"attributes\":[\r\n         {\r\n            \"trait_type\":\"Attack\",\r\n            \"value\":\"1000\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n            \"trait_type\":\"Durability\",\r\n            \"value\":\"500\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n            \"trait_type\":\"Element\",\r\n            \"value\":\"Fire\"\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   },\r\n   {\r\n      \"name\":\"Mythical Shield\",\r\n      \"high_res_img_url\":\"https://example.com/mythical_shield.jpg\",\r\n      \"attributes\":[\r\n         {\r\n            \"trait_type\":\"Defense\",\r\n            \"value\":\"800\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n            \"trait_type\":\"Durability\",\r\n            \"value\":\"800\"\r\n         },\r\n         {\r\n            \"trait_type\":\"Element\",\r\n            \"value\":\"Ice\"\r\n         }\r\n      ]\r\n   }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow for people to express arbitrary metadata that is webapps choice to present or not, while still having the digital artifact intact, and allowing to: focus on inscribing the artifact, with a low quality of image to pay less (leading to better scaling) while still being able to provide a high res image, if it exists. Also allows to express, immutably on the chain, attributes and a name for the individual inscription (rather than just Inscription *number*). This way, only the high res image would be mutable, but then it is an optional field, you can always use the bytes available on the inscription.\r\n\r\nAnd this would prevent/disincentivize people from just upload a text/json ContentType with arbitrary metadata that can be changed later, as it would preserve the artifact on chain.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a solution for this *will happen* as people will look into how to scale this.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think @casey? Also curious how you think about this.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5WvBGF","author":{"login":"OpenFibers"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"\"Digital artifacts are complete.

Compiled ord 0.5.1 from source. Began indexing, ran up to 765k block fast and without errors, then bombed (I didn't catch the exact message, but it was similar to this one). \r\n\r\nStarted researching, turned txindex=1, then rest=1 on for bitcoind - same error. After googling by tx ID found this thread ;-)\r\n\r\nThe block it originally bombed on was 767430 (same as here) and same tx ID a2df039d22ce84803de677328efe3a2fe82b0102d66c32f899715608babd1214\r\n\r\nTurned debug on, went past block 767430, now bombed on 767433 trying to fetch the same tx ID. When rerunning the index command keep getting the error on the same tx ID, but each time it claims a different [prior] block that supposedly had already been indexed.\r\n\r\nTried looking up this tx via ordinals.com explorer - it finds it, and it's actually in block 767427\r\nhttps://ordinals.com/tx/a2df039d22ce84803de677328efe3a2fe82b0102d66c32f899715608babd1214\r\nhttps://ordinals.com/block/767427\r\n\r\nMy hunch is maybe either the ord index got corrupt when being built or somehow my local copy of the blockchain is corrupt (how's that possible?! - bitcoind continues interacting with peers fine). But what a coincidence ord needing to fetch more info on exactly the same tx and not finding it!\r\n\r\nAnyhow, here are some logs. Appreciate any hints!\r\n\r\n[2023-02-27T18:47:06Z DEBUG bitcoincore_rpc] JSON-RPC request: getblockhash [767429]\r\n[2023-02-27T18:47:06Z INFO  ord::index::updater] Block 767428 at 2022-12-14

Specifically, we restrict JS in all other types (HTML and SVG) by the application of CSP. These restrictions greatly inhibit the following (purposefully or otherwise):\r\n\r\n- Pointers - CSP configuration only allows referencing 'self' and as such prevents loading content from IPFS or Arweave\r\n- XSS - Partial mitigation to a whole range of XSS vulnerabilities by the same mechanism as above\r\n- Recursion - Without this protection #1082 is possible, but without structure/control/protections\r\n\r\n\r\nI think we can all agree pointers being functional on anything that _appears_ to be on Ordinals.com is detrimental. Currently it is possible to create a PDF that will link (pointers) to outside content, utilize potentially malicious XSS vectors, and/or pull content from other inscriptions without the need to fight the existing CSP. This can all be done in a way that, to casual users, will appear to be a 'standard' inscription.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I feel that my assessment of this being \"outside the sandbox\" is true unless we say that there is no intent to have a sandbox (at which point the existence of the CSP becomes an oddity). \r\n\r\nTowards this, I believe that controls around PDFs are not only reasonable, but necesarry if we wish to remain isolated from Pointers, mitigate (not eliminate) XSS vulnerability, and have structured Recusion on Ord's terms instead of just however users can best circumvent the restrictions. I **don't** believe any restrictions on _Inscribing_ PDFs is reasonable or justified.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VYiEu","author":{"login":"tyjvazum"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"What potential mitigations do you propose?","createdAt":"2023-02-16T04:24:19Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1744#issuecomment-1432494382","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VYmB5","author":{"login":"Psifour"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"My proposed mitigations range wildly within the following options: \r\n\r\n- Enforce all /content links to PDFs as a download instead of displaying in browser. This moves the ball fully into the users court and would, hopefully, trigger the part of users brains that knows not to blindly open downloaded files. This addresses the confusion that currently there is no user awareness in regards to if an inscription is html/text or a pdf until AFTER they have opened it. Drawbacks include greatly reduced UX.\r\n- Disable PDFs from the primary Ordinals.com explorer while still including them in the index and count. Drawbacks include inadvertently restricting access to potentially meaningful content.\r\n- Sandbox the PDFs using something like pdf.js with enableScripting set to false (assuming this hasn't been forked out as indicated by a PR removing it from their examples). Drawbacks include fully breaking any great uses of JS within PDFs.\r\n- Add a disclaimer interstitial page the first time a user accesses a PDF /content page that warns them that PDFs will be loaded by their browser and are not subject to the sandboxing found in other data types. Drawbacks include slightly impacted UI/UX and a box that users will blindly click through before still being surprised that things weren't restricted in the same way as they have come to expect from other file types.\r\n\r\nI am not convinced that there is an elegant solution that restricts them to exactly the same functionality as our html/svg pages, but I know that the current state doesn't seem optimal.","createdAt":"2023-02-16T04:55:43Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1744#issuecomment-1432510585","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5Vep4W","author":{"login":"mccordnate"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"It sounds to me like the 3rd option (sandbox) is the best here:\r\n\r\n- Most meaningful content will likely not contain JS, so their functionality will be 100% intact\r\n- If it happens to be a PDF with good uses for JS then the user can download it at that point to run it on their own\r\n- This actually adds the benefit of being able to look over the file prior to downloading, making it easier to at least prevent downloading & opening obviously malicious files.","createdAt":"2023-02-17T04:52:29Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1744#issuecomment-1434099222","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"labels":[],"number":1744,"reactionGroups":[],"title":"Lack of Restrictions for PDFs","updatedAt":"2023-02-17T04:52:29Z"},{"body":"- IT Sec \r\n  - weird crash\r\n  - messed up cert -> phishing attempt\r\n  - chromebooks for ordinals work/ google workspace\r\n  - dev laptop \r\n  - VPNs (Mullvad, private Wiregurad VPN to throwaway VPS)\r\n  - Dev Box server (thin client model)\r\n  - Disposable devices\r\n- DevOps/SRE\r\n  - server maintenance stuff\r\n  - who wants to be on call \r\n  - follow up with Casey\r\n- Discuss malicious PDF\r\n  - PDF broke out of sandbox \r\n    - did not \"break out\"\r\n    - `/content` is like going to untrusted site\r\n    - issue reduces to browser security\r\n  - fixed for now\r\n- Stream Discord Coding session on Twitch as well\r\n- Based Discord channels for daily dev streaming\r\n  - for scaling dev work\r\n","comments":[],"labels":[],"number":1743,"reactionGroups":[],"title":"Salt Mines standup 2023-2-13 ","updatedAt":"2023-02-14T22:51:55Z"},{"body":"Command used:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./ord wallet inscribe FILE --fee-rate 13\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```\r\nerror: wallet does not contain enough cardinal UTXOs, please add additional funds to wallet.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent UTXOs checked with `./ord wallet outputs`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"output\": \"tx1:0\",\r\n    \"amount\": 10000\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"output\": \"tx2:0\",\r\n    \"amount\": 200000\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes it mean `ord` looks for the first output ignoring the second with enough funds to spend?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I am on a `speedup-improvements` branch, @andrewtoth's [repo](https://github.com/andrewtoth/ord).\r\nEDIT: repo is not relevant as it happens on the main ord and on a andrewtoth's one.","comments":[{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VQTbz","author":{"login":"raphjaph"},"authorAssociation":"COLLABORATOR","body":"If both outputs contain inscriptions then yes.

Can you describe a little bit more about what you're looking to get out of this feature?\r\n\r\nI have lots of thoughts, but it depends a lot on the use-case. I can't think a good way to make inscriptions non-transferrable. They sit on sats, and sats are transferrable.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for something like soul-bound tokens, I have an idea. Making up a use-case: Let's say that you, Rag, are trying to certify people as knowing a lot about 3D-printed firearms. You want to certify me. I have an inscription that I use as my personal identity, CASEYPFP and you have an inscription you use as your personal identity, RAGPFP.\r\n\r\nYou use RAGPFP (using #783 when implemented) to make an inscription that says, in text \"I'm Rag and I saw CASEYPFP field-strip an FGC-9 in 10 seconds.\" (we can make this better, but that's just a sketch) Only the RAGPFP holder can do this, and it refers to CASEYPFP by the inscription ID, so everyone can see the connection. I can then point people to this inscription.\r\n\r\nIf you want to revoke it, you send it to a burn address using #1588. You can even, in the OP_RETURN payload, say *why* you're revoking it. Maybe I didn't pay my 3D gun printing club dues, so you just say \"nbd, you have to be a member to have this certification, so if casey wants to rejoin he's welcome and we'll make a new one\". Or you can say something like \"Casey turned out not to actually know anything about 3D-printed firearms, he's a fraud\", or whatever.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?","createdAt":"2023-02-10T22:16:37Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1657#issuecomment-1426410600","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VBaF3","author":{"login":"RagnarLifthrasir"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"You described my use case, and know me too well.\r\n\r\nCan #783 make a personal identity 1) human readable, 2) globally unique, and strongly owned?

That is the most important one, and it hasn't really been explained to me why it was made (see https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1364).\r\n\r\nSo because it skips indexing past blocks, it doesn't know the input values of new blocks once it hits the first inscription block. It has to fetch every input transaction and get its output value, which is very slow. As we index more and more blocks though this becomes more rare, because more new transactions will spend more recent inputs which we've now indexed. By not skipping any blocks, we never have to fetch previous inputs though because we have indexed them all. However, that requires indexing every block which is even slower.\r\n\r\nI suspect that it was disabled because it was causing the RPC server to fall over from too many requests. This was because a background thread was using RPC to fetch block hashes and blocks, and the main thread was using RPC to fetch missing transactions. So my patch also uses the P2P interface to fetch headers and blocks, which is much more efficient than using the RPC interface for that. I optionally also try and use the REST interface to fetch the missing transactions, because it is more efficient than RPC for that as well (see https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1558#issuecomment-1421864816). But, after seeing the Mac errors and having to rewrite it using only a single connection, it seems like it might not be that much of an improvement. See https://github.com/casey/ord/pull/1636#issuecomment-1427061691.\r\nBut without using the RPC interface on a background thread, it doesn't cause RPC server to fall over so I think this should be re-enabled with just the P2P interface for now.","createdAt":"2023-02-12T15:44:05Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1648#issuecomment-1427064189","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VEIa8","author":{"login":"so7ow"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Is this speedup patch included in 0.5.0 release?","createdAt":"2023-02-12T22:14:50Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1648#issuecomment-1427146428","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VEJnS","author":{"login":"andrewtoth"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@so7ow I just pushed an update to the REST library I am using.

For block periods of low tx activity this uses little memory, and for periods of high activity it uses a lot of memory (4GB+). This is not ideal for either case.

This can be tricky with `HashMap` and `Vec` since they reallocate on their own and their capacity can be higher, but we can track our current entries' sizes and flush on a conservative amount to keep our memory usage to a certain level. Before flushing we can `shrink_to_fit` the caches as well before draining them.\r\n\r\nThis will also keep the commit times to a consistent level. Some users complain that some flushes take a very long time and get frustrated without seeing any progress.\r\n\r\nAlso, how much memory should we try and stay below by default?

If `dbcache` is not possible to get, then make the memory top default 2GB (we could test to find a more optimal, data based value, this is just what I think it makes sense).

Burning a sat is already a well-defined and well-understood concept in Bitcoin.\r\n2. A `burn1…` address with a payload allows including arbitrary messages at burn time.\r\n3. A `burn1…` address relies on existing functionality (sending to an address) and it will be easy for users to understand.\r\n4. New protocol additions require research, implementation, review, and ongoing maintenance, and we must figure out how they fit into the protocol.\r\n5. We can allow burning a sat and inscription via sending to an OP_RETURN first, and then strategically consider if any use-cases that aren't served are worth the additional protocol level complexity.\r\n6.

I came here looking to see if any of this was already being talked about. Recently tweeted this:\r\nhttps://twitter.com/sull/status/1626824019176456193\r\n\r\nAs an independent thought experiment before finding this thread, I might as well chime in.\r\n\r\nRelated to the specifics of this thread, I think there is merit in having a no-index ref client (vanilla publisher wallet). \r\nI also agree with @casey that Ord should have a minimal publish mode to handle content that lets just say isnt intended to be a part of a market and so those related features should be able to be...skipped and/or extend the protocol to make clear there is support for general publish (vanilla inscriptions) use case.\r\n\r\nAnother line oif thought that was even touched on in this thread is the potocol specifier (prefix). Software depends on this, AFAIK, for targeted data parsing. I suppose additional verification is done too by analyzing the envelope content. But the idea of Ord forking is going to happen so this discussion is important now. \r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts on implementing namespaces to distinguish among many Ord runner instances where a subset of conventions, rules, instructions etc can be applied with a namespace metadata file inscribed to a parent ordinal/sat owned by the namespace creator? This requires thinking broadly and into the future, as well as accepting the likely occurrences with or without forward thinking proposals.\r\n\r\nSo a namespace can be added to the protocol specifier like **protocol:namespace**\r\n\r\nE.g . **ord:stet**\r\n\r\nThis actually introduces a loose SLD name system, if we continue to take pretend things and make them real through a concerted community and dev effort.... consensus. \r\n\r\nI'm sure at this point you are thinking... is ORD now a TLD in this Ordinal world? Sure why not? \r\n\r\nE.g. **stet.ord** is the pointer to the Ordinal tree associated with it. It could be a complete website directory of onchain inscriptions (that would be cached by apps).\r\n\r\nIn Ordinal world, we rely on software to turn pretend things into reality. It is arbitrary from the top and therefor all the way down, if we choose to. Suddenly. this simple idea could result in organized onchain data repos with its own description and metadata, used in different ways and interfaces and easily acced with a ad hoc DNS system where .ORD is the TLD.\r\n\r\nBitcoin/Ordinal Wallets will become \"web browser\" hybrids where all content is onchain and cached for speed.\r\n\r\nThis may discouage some rogue forking (not that there's anything nec wrong with that) and encourage creating namespaces and keeping Ordinal as the umbrella project. One anticipated reason to fork with new protocol specifier would be to duplicate rare sat serials in an attempt to recreate demand for speculative scarcity. By supporting namespaces, I think it would make such _shitords_ motivation more obvious.\r\n\r\nI'll end with an example of a namespace. \r\n\r\n**nytimes.ord** \r\n\r\nIn the namespace metadata file, it states it is a text-only archive of articles. \r\nThere is an index page (versioning?) that just lists and links to all articles or just an intro/summary statement with link to centralized dynamic page that lists all onchain articles (inscription IDs). \r\nThis namespace could also instruct apps to use certain flags to disable tracking, not bind to sats or generally opting out to being a tradable \"NFT\". Just inscriptions. \r\n\r\nYou get the idea ;) \r\n\r\nI'm looking forward to your feedback. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","createdAt":"2023-02-20T06:58:11Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/1501#issuecomment-1436436306","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"labels":[],"number":1501,"reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"title":"Vanilla inscriptions","updatedAt":"2023-02-20T06:58:11Z"},{"body":"Audio previews should be more visually interesting.

I've been working in the direction you mentioned and came up with given solution & raised a PR [here](https://github.com/casey/ord/pull/1906/files).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n1. While running ord inscribe command, user can add **'--metadata'** flag (optional) and pass on traits in JSON form. The JSON will be added in the inscribing envelop as another segment and broadcasted on-chain. eg.\r\n`ord wallet inscribe --metadata \"data\"`\r\nAn example of data passed:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"traits\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"trait_type\": \"hair\",\r\n      \"value\": \"Short Black\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"trait_type\": \"cap\",\r\n      \"value\": \"Blue Cap\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. While showing the inscription details on explorer, we will show **traits** section if metadata is NOT NULL and has whitelisted key \"**traits**\" in it. Showing ss demonstrating the content passed in that key.\r\n[image_link](https://linkpicture.com/q/Screenshot-2023-03-10-at-2.48.01-AM.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce collections and provenance gets established, we can easily compute rarity % for traits in items & collections. \r\nThis can encourage more community-based NFT projects to join Ordinals and create new collections. Happy to incorporate changes if community has any thoughts.\r\n\r\nNote: Validating JSON in metadata input and parsing key-value pair on explorer UI is pending.

It's a simplifying assumption that makes the code much simpler. The wallet won't lose inscriptions if there's more than one per UTXO, but it doesn't have functionality for splitting UTXOs automatically to send particular inscriptions. In general, this can require multiple transactions in order to avoid creating dust outputs. We may want to revisit that assumption later on, but only if we absolutely have to.\r\n\r\nSo I think that the wallet making one inscription per UTXO is the way to go. However, we might want the protocol to be more flexible. See my comment above, but I'm deciding between automatically hopping to the next UTXO, or having an optional padding field in each inscription, which gives a number of sats to skip before assigning an inscription.","createdAt":"2023-01-13T19:12:21Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/876#issuecomment-1382268483","viewerDidAuthor":false}],"labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOGhOAhc8AAAABJFERQw","name":"consensus","description":"","color":"4F45B7"}],"number":876,"reactionGroups":[],"title":"Bundles","updatedAt":"2023-01-22T21:02:29Z"},{"body":"Reported by @VirtuallyThere:\n\n> ord index is terminating every few thousands - ten thousands blocks for no apparent reason and without error message - so I need to run it in a loop from the shell....

Seller should set the price such that it's close to what sellers are willing to pay. If it's below what sellers are willing to pay, then they will increase their \"bid\" by adding fees, which will go to miners. There are probably a bunch of different auction mechanism, where the value is split in different ways between miners and sellers.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, you have the #1611 method, where miners get all bids. On the other hand, you have a descending price auction where the seller continually releases PBSTs with lower and lower prices until someone takes it and pays EV - FEE to the seller, where EV is expected value, and FEE is what's required to get it mined, which goes to the miner.","createdAt":"2023-02-09T08:36:42Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/802#issuecomment-1423818959","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VDGW8","author":{"login":"MuffinsThaCat"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"Something like this:?\r\n\r\nconst bitcoin = require(\"bitcoinjs-lib\");\r\nconst bip32 = require(\"bip32\");\r\nconst bip39 = require(\"bip39\");\r\n\r\nconst mnemonic = \"a random mnemonic phrase used as seed for BIP32\";\r\nconst seed = bip39.mnemonicToSeed(mnemonic);\r\nconst node = bip32.fromSeed(seed);\r\nconst keyPairB = node.derivePath(\"m/44'/0'/0'/0/1\").keyPair;\r\nconst keyPairC = node.derivePath(\"m/44'/0'/0'/0/2\").keyPair;\r\n\r\nconst network = bitcoin.networks.testnet;\r\nconst p2pkhB = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({ pubkey: keyPairB.publicKey, network });\r\nconst p2pkhC = bitcoin.payments.p2pkh({ pubkey: keyPairC.publicKey, network });\r\nconst p2pkhMaker = \"the address for the maker\";\r\nconst p2pkhTaker = \"the address for the taker\";\r\n\r\nlet psbt = new bitcoin.Psbt({ network });\r\n\r\npsbt.addInput({\r\n  hash: \"the hash of transaction A\",\r\n  index: 0,\r\n  nonWitnessUtxo: Buffer.from(\"00\", \"hex\"),\r\n});\r\n\r\npsbt.addInput({\r\n  hash: \"the hash of transaction B\",\r\n  index: 0,\r\n  witnessUtxo: {\r\n    script: p2pkhB.output,\r\n    value: N,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\npsbt.addInput({\r\n  hash: \"the hash of transaction C\",\r\n  index: 0,\r\n  witnessUtxo: {\r\n    script: p2pkhC.output,\r\n    value: M,\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\r\npsbt.addOutput({\r\n  address: p2pkhMaker,\r\n  value: N,\r\n});\r\n\r\npsbt.signInput(2, keyPairC, null, bitcoin.Transaction.SIGHASH_SINGLE | bitcoin.Transaction.SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY);\r\n\r\nconst partiallySignedPsbt = psbt.toBase64();\r\nconsole.log(\"Partially signed PSBT:\", partiallySignedPsbt);\r\n\r\n// Maker broadcasts PSBT\r\n\r\npsbt = bitcoin.Psbt.fromBase64(partiallySignedPsbt);\r\n\r\npsbt.addOutput({\r\n  address: p2pkhTaker,\r\n  value: M,\r\n});\r\n\r\npsbt.signAllInputs(keyPairB);\r\n\r\nconst signedTransaction = psbt.finalizeAllInputs().extractTransaction().toHex();\r\nconsole.log(\"Signed transaction:\", signedTransaction);\r\n\r\n// Taker broadcasts transaction\r\n\r\n// When transaction is mined, maker receives ordinal sats in Y for payment, taker receives cardinal sats in X","createdAt":"2023-02-11T21:01:13Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}}],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/802#issuecomment-1426875836","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VD4ld","author":{"login":"dajuguan"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"I think the script should use \"p2tr\" because ordinals are inscribed in the p2tr scripts.","createdAt":"2023-02-12T17:01:38Z","includesCreatedEdit":false,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/802#issuecomment-1427081565","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5VLKrS","author":{"login":"cyclomancer"},"authorAssociation":"NONE","body":"> In offers to buy, can people include change so they an use input uxos of any size?\r\n\r\n@casey, one way to support this is for the maker to include output Y, paying to the same address as the desired ordinal UTXO, output Z paying themselves change, and sign with SIGHASH_ALL.

So, in the \"Ask: Offer to sell sats\" theoretical algo, anyone can buy. Makes sense, but how to enforce that the buyer will pay the specific price of cardinal sats? e.g. will not try to pay less?

BitTorrent V2 is a much better, simpler, sounder protocol.\r\n\r\nRequirements for any off-chain storage:\r\n\r\n- Content must be referenced with a standard hash function digest that is not protocol specific. SHA-256 is attractive, because it does not introduce any new security assumptions, since Bitcoin already relies on SHA-256. BitTorrent V2's SHA-256 merkle tree is nonstandard, but is so simple that I'll give it a pass. BLAKE3 is attractive for its extremely fast hashing, but it introduces a new security assumption, that BLAKE3 is secure. IPFS multihashes are eliminated by this requirement, because they are linked to that specific protocol, in addition to additional issues with IPFS.\r\n\r\n- It must be possible to inform the user of the health of content stored off chain. How many copies are there? Are they complete? This can only be accomplished by actually attempting to fetch random chunks of the content. The approach of torrent sites is reasonable here, we could display seeders and leachers. Fetching random chunks of the content eliminates IPFS again, because the protocol is so complex that we cannot implement ourselves, and it's such a heavy dependency that we wouldn't want to pull it in.\r\n\r\n- It must be easy for users to download content that they care about, and serve it for other users. \"Easy\" in this case doesn't mean that the user can do it, but it requires multiple manual steps and additional software. Users must be able to automatically, using the software they already have installed, namely `ord`, fetch, store, and replicate off-chain content. Ord should do this automatically for any content in their wallet.

Work in progress, release planned for week starting March 6th.\r\n\r\nProvenance is important for art, and a large part of how it derives its value. We should have some notion of the provenance of an inscription:\r\n\r\n- For an inscription, see who made it\r\n- For a creator, see which inscriptions they've made\r\n- Allow referencing an inscription within an artist's body of work by number or name (maybe just name, so they aren't confused with symbols) `/ARTIST_SYMBOL/NUMBER`\r\n\r\nThis will likely be accomplished as follows:\r\n\r\n- If the inscription reveal transaction contains more than one input, the first ordinal of the first input is the \"prime\" ordinal\r\n- If inscription has a prime ordinal, the first output of the inscription is ignored for the purposes of figuring out which ordinals are inscribed\r\n- If an inscription has a prime ordinal, the inscription page should link to the prime ordinal's page\r\n- If an ordinal has been used as a prime ordinal, the ordinal page should list all inscriptions it's made\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to make a series of related inscriptions:\r\n\r\n- If an inscription is part of a collection, it should link to the collection page\r\n- The collection page should link to all inscriptions in the collection\r\n- The collection page should have some description about the collection\r\n- It should be possible to nest collections. E.g. create a collection that contains multiple collections.\r\n- Collections should have provenance. You should be able to see the scribe who created a collection, and see the collections issued by a scribe.\r\n- It should be possible to make a collection closed-ended, e.g. guarantee that it isn't possible to issue more items.\r\n- It should be possible link to an item in a collection by number or possibly name, e.g. - `/COLLECTION_SYMBOL/NUMBER` or `/COLLECTION_SYMBOL/NAME`.\r\n\r\nDesign sketch:\r\n\r\n- Reuse prime ordinals from #783. A collection is just a prime ordinal, and all the inscriptions that it's made. \r\n- If you want to add a description to the collection, make an inscription on the prime ordinal used to issue the collection.\r\n- If you want to close the collection, send the prime ordinal to an OP_RETURN. (I don't actually like this. It seems bad to force burning the prime ordinal of a collection.

That can work but limits functionalities like dynamic allocation of pieces in the collection, and if you want to allow your community to inscribe the NFTs (to avoid paying all the fees), they need to trust you to wrap it all with a \"parent inscription\" that will state that they are within the collection. \r\n\r\n**Signatures** - The convo here about \"where\" to place the signature is pretty much irrelevant, as there are multiple ways to add metadata (natively into the files -exif and such, multipart content type, another inscription which indicates).  The real focus is on how and what we should sign. a general message from the author's wallet is vulnerable because an attacker can take this signature and attach it to another inscription which will make it \"official\".\r\n\r\n### There are two solutions that can work:\r\n1. **Pre-inscribing:**  Adding metadata of \"token_id\",\"collection_name\", \"author wallet\", and \"unique_signature\" into the inscription. and the unique signature will be based on https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Message_signing which can be validated later on, and will contain the \"token_id\" + \"collection_name\" + \"author wallet\". That way the signed message is not general as it is represented by each \"token_id\" which is unique for every inscription in the collection. This can be generated upfront and added to the file natively before the inscribing even begins. [Big advantage here is that we can leverage the web3.js infra which is widely adopted already to create signatures from other protocols]\r\n\r\n2. **Post-Inscribing:** Creating a new inscription with the metadata that is meant to be the parent. It will include the data of: \"inscription id\", \"collection_name\", \"author wallet\", and \"unique_signature\". The unique signature will contain \"inscription id\"+\"collection_name\",+\"author wallet\". That way we can validate that this inscription really belongs to the author or collection we want. (we can also create metadata-inscription (parent) for multiple child inscriptions, with 1 signature that can be more efficient in fees).\r\n\r\nIn both solutions, we are leveraging the signing functionality to determine the authority of the inscriptions but one is based on \"inscription_id\" and one is determined by \"token_id\".\r\n\r\nFYI: We have created a tool to add metadata into jpegs https://digital-artifacts.io already which you can test for that purpose. it is currently biased toward solution number 1 (pre-inscribing) but will be changed as to what the project will decide.\r\n<img width=\"1049\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-03-04 at 21 52 56\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69144568/222926059-74abc23d-c3c6-4ae8-8fd1-51a2ac7b336a.png\">","createdAt":"2023-03-04T19:54:59Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[{"content":"THUMBS_UP","users":{"totalCount":2}},{"content":"ROCKET","users":{"totalCount":1}}],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/783#issuecomment-1454856868","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5Wu_vr","author":{"login":"rot13maxi"},"authorAssociation":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"One tradeoff with the “have the parent be an input to the reveal tx” method of linkage is that collections will have to be inscribed serially (at least in terms of the transaction graph, in practice, CPFP would let you have ~20 of them in the mempool at a time”.

If they add support for ordinals, outputs would be mixed with regular payment outputs. Wallet balance will need to be calculated by excluding the ordinal outputs as well. You can have some kind of system to keep track of and separate the outputs, but that quickly becomes very complex. Using a separate derivation path just for ordinals makes it much easier for wallets. All your ordinal outputs are on a different path or \"separate wallet\" essentially, no special logic required to manage the wallet. \r\n\r\nIt would be great to standardize on a new derivation path so that more Bitcoin wallets like what we're building at [Xverse](https://xverse.app) can add support.\r\n","createdAt":"2023-02-07T05:49:04Z","includesCreatedEdit":true,"isMinimized":false,"minimizedReason":"","reactionGroups":[],"url":"https://github.com/casey/ord/issues/62#issuecomment-1420234638","viewerDidAuthor":false},{"id":"IC_kwDOGhOAhc5Up0Zu","author":{"login":"casey"},"authorAssociation":"OWNER","body":"Gotcha, that makes total sense.
